This is a simple ToDoList application created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, with the help of Vite as the build tool. The application saves data to the local storage to persist tasks between sessions.

## Features

### Prerequisites

```

This will start the development server and you can view the application by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.
